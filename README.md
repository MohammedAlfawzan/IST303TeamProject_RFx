# IST303TeamProject_RFx
1. Team Members
  My team members are Mohammed Alfawzan and Akhilesh Prakash Rajeswari.

2. Come up with a concept for your application.
  ArcGIS offers users to ability to leverage raster imagery data from data extraction, preparation, visualization to analysis. On ArcGIS Pro, these imagery capabilities are inplemented as a set of raster functions, divided to various categories based on their application fields. Each raster function has a set of parameters and its associated required data type.
  For example, check out documentation on clip raster function (https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/raster-functions/clip-function.htm). 
  **During each release of ArcGIS Pro, the parameters and its required data types could change. We need something like a web database app that tracks the development of raster function changes across different releases of Pros. **
   
3. Identify all the relevant project stakeholders.

  The key stakeholder in this project is Imagery/Raster team at Esri, and whoever that uses raster functions internally with Esri.

4. Create an initial set of project requirements expressed as user stories. User stories must have estimates of completion times.

  1) a database that provides easy lookup of all raster functions and their parameters in all the previous ArcGIS Pro releases
  2) a comparison capability that generates the changes in between releases
  3) a filtering and search capability that allows the user of the website to find the specific function they are looking for
  4) the ability to assign a raster function to a function owner (developer)
